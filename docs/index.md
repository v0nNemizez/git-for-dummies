This is a guide to using git for version control. Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project. It tracks changes to files and allows developers to work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.

Here is a example of a git workflow for a project with multiple developers:

1. **Clone** the repository to your local machine
2. **Create a branch** for your feature
3. **Add** and **commit** your changes
4. **Push** your branch to the remote repository
5. **Create a pull request** to merge your branch into the master branch
6. **Review** the pull request
7. **Merge** the pull request
8. **Delete** the branch

Each step is explained in more detail under the [Commands](Commands) section.
